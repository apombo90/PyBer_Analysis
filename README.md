# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
Analysis done for a ride-sharing app (Pyber) to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create compelling visualizations that will help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. The analysis was done by completing the following tasks:

  1.  Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
  2.  Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources
- Data source: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
