# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
Analysis done for a ride-sharing app (Pyber) to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create compelling visualizations that will help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. The analysis was done by completing the following tasks:

  1.  Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
  2.  Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources
- Data source: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Jupyter Notebook
## Results
- Rural cities have the less number of rides with only the 5.3% of the total rides, followed by Suburban cities that had the 26.3% of the total number of rides and leaving Urban cities with the highest volume of rides, 68.4% of the total.
- The diffrence among types of cities is bigger in terms of number of drivers. Urban cities have the 80.9% of total drivers 
- Urban cities are generating the most

- Urban cities have too many drivers, in fact they have more drivers than rides and the company could have more drivers in the Rural or Suburban areas where the demand is higher than the number of drivers. This will allow te company to reduce the number of drivers that are not producing any income in the Urban areas and at the same time it will meet the demand in the Rural and Suburban Areas.
- On average, Rural cities are paying the highest *fare per ride* and this underserved regions could represent a higher profit for the company. This is worth considering to determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods specially when on average riders are paying $10 more per ride compared to Urban cities.
- Finally, more resources and support is needed for the Suburban and Rural cities to meet the demand and generate more revenue. There are not many drivers in this cities
